  <p>{% blocktrans %}GrantNav is 360Giving’s search-engine for grants data. It is a free-to-use platform that brings together open, comparable grants data published in the 360Giving Data Standard. GrantNav makes it easy to search, explore and download data across billions of pounds of grants given by a wide range of UK grantmakers.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}For the list of organisations featured in this platform, visit: <a href="https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/funders">https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/funders</a>.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}New data is added to GrantNav as more organisations publish more of their grants in the 360Giving Data Standard.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}GrantNav has been developed to help find out which organisations have funded which sectors or regions, so resources – and how they change over time – can be mapped. This helps funders to get a quick overview of other organisations working in the same areas.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
