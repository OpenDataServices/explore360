      <h1>Data used in GrantNav</h1>

      <p>The data used by GrantNav is open data. GrantNav contains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data published to the <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/standard/">360Giving Data Standard</a></li>
        <li>Data derived from <a
            href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/code-point-open.html">Code-Point Open</a>
        </li>
        <li>Data derived from <a href="http://data.charitycommission.gov.uk/default.aspx">Charity Commission data</a></li>
        <li>Data derived from <a
            href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ward-to-local-government-district-april-2015-lookup-in-northern-ireland">Northern
            Ireland Ward to Council Area Lookup</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Data published to the 360Giving Data Standard is taken from an <a href="http://data.threesixtygiving.org/">up to date
          list on the 360Giving website</a>. The <a href="/datasets/#datasets-used">360Giving Datasets Used table</a> below
        lists the specific datasets used in GrantNav, how they are licensed, and when they were retrieved.
      </p>

      <p>We use the <a
          href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/code-point-open.html">Code-Point Open</a>
        data to augment some of the location data. We use the <a
          href="http://data.charitycommission.gov.uk/default.aspx">Charity Commission data</a> to look up charity names. Both
        these datasets are licensed under an <a
          href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government License</a>.
      <p>

      <h2>Updates to data in GrantNav</h2>

      <p>GrantNav is updated on a daily basis. In order for data to be included in updates of GrantNav, the dataset needs to
        meet these three criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Listed on the <a href="http://data.threesixtygiving.org/">360Giving Data Registry</a>;</li>
        <li>Openly licensed;</li>
        <li>Valid according to the schema used for the 360Giving Data Standard.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The data listed on the 360Giving Data Registry is downloaded each day into the 360Giving Datastore. The Datastore
        then creates a data package which is loaded into Grantnav.</p>

      <p>When GrantNav is updated, the data included may change. There are several reasons for this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>An organisation has updated its data to include more grants</li>
        <li>New organisations have published data in the 360Giving Data Standard</li>
        <li>Data that was previously in GrantNav is no longer available</li>
        <li>We have received a request from an organisation to take their data down</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If a dataset linked from the 360Giving Data Registry becomes invalid according to the 360Giving Data Standard schema
        or temporarily unavailable, for example because the location of the dataset has changed, the data package loaded into
        GrantNav will use the last valid downloaded version of the dataset. The 360Giving Datastore keeps a backup version of
        each dataset for 30 days. If a dataset remains invalid or unavailable the data will disappear from GrantNav after 31
        days. In these cases, 360Giving will work closely with the relevant organisation to ensure continued access to their
        data in GrantNav.</p>
      <p>Take down requests - requests to remove data listed on the 360Giving Data Registry or data from GrantNav - are
        managed by a separate process which is not affected by the daily update and backup cycles. This process is detailed in
        our <a href="http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/take_down_policy">Take Down Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>Reporting a problem with data</h2>
      <p>If you see a problem with any data on this site, please report it directly to the relevant organisation. To find out
        how to contact them, see the "Where is this data from?" section at the bottom of each grant page.
