<h1>GrantNav for Developers</h1>

<h2>Contributing to GrantNav</h2>
<p>GrantNav is open source software by <a href="http://threesixtygiving.org">360Giving</a>. We welcome feedback, comments and pull requests <a href="https://github.com/OpenDataServices/grantnav">on GitHub</a>. We hope that GrantNav provides a useful example of how to work with 360Giving data. If you're developing an application that uses 360Giving data, we'd love to hear from you - email us at <a href="mailto:info@threesixtygiving.org">info@threesixtygiving.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Programmatic access to data</h2>
<p>In order to make it easier to prototype and develop applications that use 360Giving data, we offer access to the entire GrantNav data set as CSV or JSON:</p>
<p>
<p><a href="htttp://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/api/grants.json">http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/api/grants.json</a></p>
<p><a href="http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/api/grants.csv">http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/api/grants.csv</a></p>
</p>
<p>The whole data set is over 100MB and growing, so we recommend that you store the data locally for your own application to work from. The data is updated at most once a day (except in case of an error), and usually once per week if there is new data available for us to load.</p>
<p>The GrantNav data set contains data that has been published by organisations. Not all 360Giving data is included - any that fails validation, or isn't available under a suitably open license (ie, one that permits re-use for any purpose) isn't included. This means that all data in GrantNav is valid against the <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/standard/">360Giving Data Standard</a>, and is available for re-use for any purpose. 

The data set also contains augmented data that is not present in the original data set - for example, additional location data such as 'ward' and 'region' are added to grant records in order to enable some of GrantNav's filtering options to work. See the <a href="http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/datasets/">Data used in GrantNav</a> page for a full reference of all the data used in creating GrantNav, and the license under which the GrantNav data can be used.
