Organisations in GrantNav
=========================

GrantNav provides a view of all the grants associated with a single organization together in GrantNav. Because one organisation can have lots of different variations of their name ("Cancer Research UK", "cancer research uk", "CRUK", and so on), GrantNav uses the [organisation identifiers](https://org-id.guide) in the Recipient Org:Identifier and Funding Org:Identifier fields to match grants to the same organisation. 

Sometimes, publishers don't provide the same identifier for a given organisation - especially if the organisation has multiple registrations (such as both a company number and a charity number), or a particular funder doesn't have a record of their registration number, using their own internal identifier instead. In this case, a single organisation will have multiple pages on GrantNav. 

In order to provide a consistent experience, GrantNav looks up the names of registered charities in the [Charities Commission data](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/register/full-register-download) and uses the registered name for filtering.
