  <h2 id="cant_find_results">Why can't I find results that I know should match the search criteria?</h2>
  <p> GrantNav's filters show the grants which contain the selected value in the relevant field. If the publisher of the data hasn't included that data, then GrantNav's filters will exclude the grant, even if it appears that it should be included. For example, if a grant is to the “Lancaster Rowing Club” but the grant doesn’t contain any recipient location data, then using the recipient region filter to select ‘North West’ will exclude the grant from the results. This is because GrantNav needs specific types of recipient location data to know where the grant recipient is located - see <a href="#location_data">GrantNav and location data</a> for further details. If you know that a grant is in GrantNav but doesn’t appear where you’d expect, you might want to contact the publisher of the data to let them know. Visit the <a href="http://data.threesixtygiving.org">360Giving Registry</a> for a full list of organisations and their contact details.</p>

  <h2 id="zero_value_grants">Why do some grants show an award of £0?</h2>
  <p>Publishers sometimes set the grant value to be £0 for accounting reasons, or to signify something about the grant (such as that it was regranted). Refer to the relevant organisation website for the dataset for further information about their data, and to contact them for clarification. See <a href="#feedback_on_data">How can I give feedback on data in GrantNav?</a> for more information on contacting individual organisations. </p>
