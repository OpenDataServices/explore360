  <h2 id="data_in_grantnav">What data is in GrantNav?</h2>
  <p>GrantNav contains a curated selection of the data listed in the <a href="http://data.threesixtygiving.org">360Giving Registry</a>. Data loaded into GrantNav has, at a minimum, a license allowing re-use for any purpose (eg OGL, CC-BY 4.0) and validates against the <a href="http://standard.threesixtygiving.org"</a>360Giving Data Standard</a> at time of download. 360Giving aims to include as much data as possible, but omits datasets that we consider to skew results or that aren't relevant to GrantNav's users. GrantNav is updated on a daily basis. The grants data is then enhanced with data from various open datasets to help power the search tools. For details, please see the <a href="datasets">Data Used in GrantNav</a> page.</p>
