Data in GrantNav
================

## What data is in GrantNav?

Every night (UK time), GrantNav loads all data that:
* is listed in the <a href="http://data.threesixtygiving.org">360Giving Registry</a> 
* passes validation against the 360Giving Schema
* is available under a license that allows re-use for any purpose (such as OGL or CC-BY 4.0)

GrantNav incorporates some of the enhancements to data that are carried out by the 360Giving Data Store. These enhancements don't introduce any new information about the grant, but provide helpful descriptions of the information already in the grant or registration information about the organisation, such as including the names of geographical locations and providing the Charity Commission registered name, turnover and age for charities. 

For details, please see the <a href="http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/datasets/">Data Used in GrantNav</a> page.

## What data isn't included in GrantNav?

GrantNav only includes data that has been published by funders using the 360Giving Data Standard and relevant geographical or organisational administrative information. 

Other tools that work with grants data will often incorporate multiple data sources, including primary research, reports in other formats, and 360Giving data. GrantNav doesn't include anything other than the data provided by funders, with the enrichments described above.

## Errors in the data in GrantNav

The data in GrantNav is open data published by a range of grantmakers as well as data taken from official sources, such as Charity Commission and location data. For details on what data appears and where it has come from, see our [Data in GrantNav](#what-data-is-in-grantnav) section above.

### If you find an error in data about your organisation

If you see something about your organisation or the funding it has received in GrantNav that doesnâ€™t look right, please submit a [grantee amendment request](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/grantee-amendment-requests/). Please review the guidance before submitting the form to ensure your request is handled appropriately. You will need to provide a link to the relevant page in GrantNav and share your contact details so you can be updated on your request.

### If you find an error which is not about your organisation
If you need to report a problem in the data that is not about your organisation, please contact the funder who published the information directly. You can navigate to the relevant GrantNav funder page from any grant record for more information about them.
