GrantNav for Developers, Researchers & Analysts
===============================================

## Developers

GrantNav provides a rich source of grants data for developers; the JSON download for search results (or, indeed, for the full data set) can be used to experiment with 360Giving data for an application. 

GrantNav isn't designed to be incorporated into an application, and we don't guarantee API stability or performance, so developers should ensure that they don't rely on GrantNav for time-critical processes. The data's updated once a day, overnight (UK time), so it's not necessary to poll for updates more regularly than that. 

The entire data set can be exported as [JSON](http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/api/grants.json) or [CSV](http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/api/grants.csv)

The full JSON download is several hundred MB, and growing slowly as more organisations start to publish, and existing publishers add to their published data.

If you'd like to explore 360Giving data in more detail and would benefit from access to a database with more features than GrantNav offers, please get in touch with us to talk about gaining access to the [360Giving Datastore](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/360giving-datastore/).
