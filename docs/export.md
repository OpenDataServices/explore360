Downloads
============================

GrantNav allows you to download search results. This enables you to refine your results further and perform your own analysis, reports and visualisations.


## Grants search results

### Where can I download data from?

Grants search results can be downloaded in two ways from the [main search page](https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/search):

* A basic download of the results, by selecting either the CSV or JSON download buttons
* A customisable CSV by selecting the “Custom CSV” button, which enables you customise which fields are included in the download.

### What data is included?

The search results download includes the same grants that were returned for your search by taking into account any criteria set in the [search bar](search-bar) or [filters](refining-results).

If no search or filter criteria is set, the entire dataset of over 1 million grants will be downloaded. Be aware that this can take a while!

### What fields are included?

Files downloaded using the “CSV” or “JSON” download buttons will include the following fields:

* 360Giving Data Standard 10 required fields
* 360Giving Data Standard recommended fields for publishers
* Other fields that appear in the filters, for example the Type of Recipient and additional data added by 360Giving, for example Region and District

The Custom CSV download allows you to choose any of the 360Giving Data Standard fields or Additional Data fields added by GrantNav.

Tips for using the Custom CSV:

* Selecting “Add Recommended” will add the fields included in the basic CSV and JSON downloads
* Related fields are grouped together, for example, “Funding Org” contains all the fields relating to Funding Organisations.
   * A grouped field is identified by the “>” symbol
   * You can select all the fields in a related group by choosing “select all” on the top-level heading
   * You can click on the heading to expand it and select individual fields within
* Selecting “Add all” will add all the available columns (note: this is over 100 columns)
* Use the “Search for a field name” input to find specific fields to add to your chosen fields list
