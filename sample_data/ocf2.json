Many schools in the area have already benefited from our hands-on science activities this academic year, through school assemblies, workshops and after school clubs funded by parents.

                    "description": "Rose Hill Junior Youth Club offers children aged 6 -12 years, living in Rose Hill (RH) the chance to engage in safe, meaningful, creative and healthy activities. The organisation of the club is overseen and monitored by a volunteer management committee made up of local parents and residents, staff and local Councillors. The twice weekly club sessions are staffed by qualified play workers and supported by Oxfordshire Play Association. Launched in March 2011 the JYC supports up to 95 children each week at two club sessions. It is a totally inclusive club offering a wide range of activities for children aged 6 – 12 years. There is a nominal charge of 50p per child per session. This fee is waived if a parent is unable to afford the subscription. We offer specialist support to children with ADHD, Autism and Special Educational Needs (SEN) . Over 30% of children attending have some form of additional need. Many children in Rose Hill have challenging lives which impact on their behaviour. The therapeutic nature of play is crucial to their social, emotional and behavioural development. JYC offers children the opportunity to do things THEIR way, giving them autonomy, promoting self expression, allowing them to develop confidence, self worth, creativity and resilience. Often a stark contrast to life within school and home. JYC offers these children a structure of support and a choice of activities. When their needs are met (fun, societal, good food, positive reinforcement, independent choice) their behaviour improves considerably, they work through their challenges using play and spending time with trusted adults. For the majority of children attending, JYC is the only facilitated play opportunity in their lives. For the children not attending JYC, it is likely that there is none. The club also offers: ? A Young Leaders (YLs) programme for older children where: * YLs support and mentor younger ones, learn positive behaviour, social skills and self worth and support staff in chosen activities or run them independently ? A volunteering and training programme: *JYC offers support and training to local people wishing to gain experience working with children ? A healthy eating and cooking project: *children prepare, cook and serve a hot healthy tea at every session, lead by qualified nutritionist and kitchen team Our aims and objectives are: To give a child a sense of their own worth and capability To create a nurturing, safe and creative atmosphere To encourage positive language, social skills and communication To give enjoyment and respite from a child’s pressured and often traumatic life To provide an opportunity to engage in different kinds of innovative projects To work with children to raise their self esteem, self confidence and independence through creative activities To celebrate their success and encourage pride in their achievements",

We aim to make a lasting difference to people’s lives, not simply to alleviate a symptom or current problem. We encourage people who have suffered from mental distress such as depression, anxiety or schizophrenia, by linking them with volunteers and enabling supportive relationships to develop. Our volunteer befrienders are trained in understanding mental health issues and are there to encourage people to regain and develop their self-confidence. They enable people to take part in activities in their community, quietly and unobtrusively – just like anyone else. We also offer a weekly Social Group for those waiting for befriending partnerships. This was initially offered as a way of addressing the growing waiting list. The group’s friendly and informal demeanour has been very successful in encouraging reluctant individuals to participate.",

It operates with three aims: 1/ to offer PWLD choice in holiday options and day-trips at affordable (/subsidised) prices; 2/ to provide respite for those who care for PWLD; 3/ to give young people training and volunteering opportunities to support this vulnerable group on our outings both for the immediate gain of assisting positively and so they are better equipped to promote community cohesion. In 2009, Yellow Submarine partnered with two day centres and a local authority and four holidays with 19 PWLD (and their carers who gained respite) benefitting. The trips that have taken place so far have been very popular and successful both with the ‘service users’, their carers and the volunteers who helped. Video feedback can be viewed on our site, with carers saying the holidays have helped increase confidence, create new friendships, and give a welcome break! Yellow Submarine believes people with learning disabilities deserve to live life to the full. We are a small award-winning charity which prides itself on giving some of the most disadvantaged people in Oxfordshire confidence, independence and a sense of self-worth. For children (aged 11-18) living in Oxfordshire we run an extensive programme in the school holidays. For adults (18+) we run residential holidays, work experience & training and a weekly social club.

We know that the current challenges faced by local and global communities – from climate change to educational disadvantage to an ageing population – can only be solved by engaging the students of today, the leaders of tomorrow, with these pressing social issues and equipping them with the skills to solve them. We: - inspire students about social issues each year through conferences and speaker events on social issues; - connect students to opportunities to make a difference in their local communities - in local schools, care homes and food banks; - support students to set up their own charitable projects through our social leadership activities.

To do this, we employ 3 coordinators who recruit train and then supervise volunteers who undergo a 10 week preparation course which covers parenting, child development, safeguarding, confidentiality, and family welfare matters. They are then matched with families by our coordinators who assess and oversee the support for both families and volunteers. Some of our volunteers have moved into work, or started careers in related employment as a result. We also employ a part-time family support worker to work with families needing immediate and more focused help, and a part-time administrator.",

Our volunteer befrienders are trained in understanding mental health issues and are there to encourage people to regain and develop their self-confidence. They enable people to take part in activities in their community, quietly and unobtrusively – just like anyone else. We also offer a weekly Social Group for those waiting for befriending partnerships. This was initially offered as a way of addressing the growing waiting list.

It is fantastic that it is on the school grounds especially when the parents/carers drop their older siblings off at school and come straight into Group. The children are very forward after coming to Group as they have learnt how to paint, glue, draw, write etc and the teachers at the school notice this.",

The recovery programme is unique because we use Therapeutic Community (TC) Concepts linked to recovery outcomes together with a range of other therapeutic interventions. It is our aim through these programmes for clients to complete the programme and secure full-time employment, move out into independent living and no longer be ‘in treatment’. The intensive structured approach provides residents with an abstinence based pathway to recovery and re-engagement within mainstream society as contributing citizens.",

We value the positive health benefits from working with animals and nature, and are passionate about removing some of the barriers to physical exercise and accessing the outdoors which many adults with learning disabilities face. Our co-farmers spend most of the day in the fresh air engaging in a range of meaningful activities, including: collecting and grading eggs, feeding farm animals, working in an organic garden, tree planting and preparing food with fresh farm produce. The project provides a hands-on programme of training, equipping participants with real world skills to transition into work and live more independently. Through this, they learn that they 'can do', raising confidence and ultimately achievement.",

The majority of Seniors are over 75 years of age, including a couple members of over 90 years of age and a significant number are infirm and/or live on their own. A bimonthly programme of speakers, activities and trips to places of interest is organised. The subsidised cost and special transport arrangements ensure that no one is discriminated against due to lack of financial resources or physical disability. Another aim is to form a link with the young people of Cutteslowe and to this end an Intergenerational Project has been set up. The pupils of Cutteslowe Primary School meet with the Seniors and ask questions about their experiences of the War, their school days etc. Sessions are recorded and the aim is to produce an educational pack.Meeting their friends every two weeks is of great benefit to Seniors.",

We have 12 teams which start with our raising stars, or under 6s, all the way up to under 15s. We have also recently started 2 new girls’ teams.We support the local community by providing a club for the children to come and play football. This ensures the young children have a place to go, to not only develop their footballing skills, but also improves discipline, health, general well-being and most importantly, they make friends and have lots of fun!!

Despite the very welcome changes in legislation which have have given well needed protection and rights to LGBT people, there are still many who feel adversely affected by their sexuality or gender identity, including those who still feel concerned about coming out at work, those who feel guilty due to religious beliefs or cultural norms, those seeking asylum from overseas who are fleeing persecution or even the death penalty, the young who are still bullied in school and those LGBT people living in rural areas who feel very isolated. Our aim is to give a professional support service to these people via phone, email or face to face interactions with our band of dedicated and very well trained volunteers, to help our clients find a solution to solution to their issues and problems.",

To provide information related to age concerns, entertainment and occasional coach trips if funds allow. We aim to bring the elderly and in many cases, the less mobile, out of their homes and into a friendly and invigorating environment where they can make and meet friends and enjoy each others company. We are very much aware that some of the members do not always receive a good and balanced diet so wherever possible we aim to provide refreshments and nourishing meals. It is important to encourage the over 60's to socialise and be involved in activities even if they suffer from mobility issues and to that end we feel we are succeeding and want to continue our efforts and hopefully extend our facilities to an even larger section of this ever increasing section of the community.",

It is fantastic that it is on the school grounds especially when the parents/carers drop their older siblings off at school and come straight into Group. The children are very forward after coming to Group as they have learnt how to paint, glue, draw, write etc and the teachers at the school notice this.",

We create projects and social experiences that encourage children and adults to enjoy and be able to talk about reading, and make the link between reading and writing. We are meeting our aims by running an annual literary Festival for 2000 county primary school children, based at the Ashmolean, the Pitt Rivers and the Oxford Museum of Natural History every May, and 44 book groups led by our trained volunteers. 24 of these are ‘Lunchboox Clubs’ in primary schools and 20 are ‘TeaBooks Groups’ for older people, in a variety of settings: day care centres, residential homes, libraries and sheltered accommodation.",

Through the provision of weekly intergenerational groups, primarily within schools, we provide opportunities to share knowledge, skills and experiences across the generations. Our work provides opportunities to meet new people of all ages and backgrounds helping older people to combat loneliness and isolation which directly impacts health and well-being and supporting younger people with emotional development needs. By involving schools, we have a sustainable model which allows us to fund and manage the Full Circle groups for a short period of time before handing over group ownership to the schools.",

The villages are isolated communities with few facilities and transport links. The eldest member was born in 1924 and the majority are in their 70s and 80s. Many have mobility constraints and live alone. The Club is 50 strong at present and activities take place monthly. The activities are based on engagement and encouraging activities which help to maintain independence, provide mental stimulation and physical activities. This includes organized trips or events in Fritwell Village Hall. The Club is managed by a Committee of seven all of whom are volunteers. Activities reflect the needs and wants of the members and for many the trips are the only time they visit outside places.",

We run an after school club that is mainly attended by children at the local junior schools and various play schemes during school holidays when children come from further afield and include those from secondary schools. Our aim is to provide these children and young people with a safe place where they can learn to interact with others and accept those who are different from themselves as they use all our facilities.The obesity rate at the end of primary schools in Blackbird Leys is 29% yet here at the playground they are able to exercise by having fun. We also aim to provide them, during the after school club with a healthy snack. They play on the structures and have endless fun as they run round often playing imaginary games. A new in-ground trampoline has added to the choice of equipment they can use. Our staff and volunteers are trained in play principles and these encourage children to choose their own activities so that the child can make a choice that fits their mood. One of our objectives is to allow the children who come to be able to find constructive ways of coping with the different feelings they might have. They use the arts and crafts facilities, many table games such as table tennis, table football and pool and will cook and garden as well as use the many outside play structures and equipment The number of people on the estate with no formal educational qualification is high and so our staff and volunteers are able to help and encourage the children to aspire and do well at school. They will sometimes bring homework for staff to look at. We have a good selection of books they can refer to and they quite often can be seen playing schools or offices. The Constitution of Blackbird Leys Adventure Playground states: \"The objects of BLAP shall be the provision of play and recreation facilities and other leisure time occupation for children resident in and around Oxford...the facilities being a) those of which children have need by reason of their youth or social and economic circumstances and b) Those which will improve the conditions of life for such children by promoting their physical, mental and spiritual well-being.\"",

As well as the Playing Close, The Thomas Gifford Trust owns some land in the Spendlove Centre (the site of the old Spendlove Secondary School) in the middle of Charlbury. This site is adjacent to the Co-operative store, doctor's and dentist's surgeries, and other commercial enterprises and it butts onto the playing fields which contain football and rugby pitches, tennis courts and a children's playground. This land has been vacant since the demolition of the school and is the location of our proposed Community Centre, which will bring much needed sports and leisure facilities to Charlbury. The construction of this new Community Centre, which will begin in 2015, will comprise of many state of the art facilities. There will be a four badminton court sized sports hall, a contemporary library, a dance/yoga studio and social areas.The Thomas Gifford Trust together with the Charlbury Community Centre Appeal Committee has been raising funds to build this Community Centre for over 10 years. We have been awarded financial support from: Oxfordshire County Council, Charlbury Town Council, West Oxfordshire District Council, Homes and Communities Agency, Charlbury Motor and Fire Brigade Fund, private donations and local residents through the Charlbury Community Centre Appeal Fund. We are now in a position to start building, but need to raise more money for internal fixtures and fittings and to make the building as useful and attractive to as many people as possible in the town and surrounding villages.",

Since 2005 we have been running storytelling programmes in schools and communities across Oxfordshire that show the power of stories to inspire and transform learning. Our work has particularly targeted some of the most disadvantaged areas of the county and we work in partnership with a wide variety of communities and other like-minded organisations.",

                    "description": "“Yellow Submarine Holidays” provides supported holidays and activities for people with learning disabilities (PWLD). It operates with three aims: 1/ to offer PWLD choice in holiday options and day-trips at affordable (/subsidised) prices; 2/ to provide respite for those who care for PWLD; 3/ to give young people training and volunteering opportunities to support this vulnerable group on our outings both for the immediate gain of assisting positively and so they are better equipped to promote community cohesion. In 2009, Yellow Submarine partnered with two day centres and a local authority and four holidays with 19 PWLD (and their carers who gained respite) benefitting. The trips that have taken place so far have been very popular and successful both with the ‘service users’, their carers and the volunteers who helped. Video feedback can be viewed on our site, with carers saying the holidays have helped increase confidence, create new friendships, and give a welcome break! Yellow Submarine believes people with learning disabilities deserve to live life to the full. We are a small award-winning charity which prides itself on giving some of the most disadvantaged people in Oxfordshire confidence, independence and a sense of self-worth. For children (aged 11-18) living in Oxfordshire we run an extensive programme in the school holidays. For adults (18+) we run residential holidays, work experience & training and a weekly social club.
