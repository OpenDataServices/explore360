Many children born with congenital heart disease are diagnosed in the womb and can expect to have a number of operations or surgical procedures as they grow to adulthood. Non-interventional childrens cardiac surgical services are based at the Oxford Children's Hospital (CHOX) At present children needing surgery are referred to Southampton University Hospital or Great Ormond Street pending the outcome of a government review later in 2014.This results in ongoing financial and emotional problems for the families. Young Hearts is campaigning to bring back surgical services to Oxford to complement the existing paediatric cardiac care provided in Oxford. Our organisation provides help, support and in some cases financial support to parents using these services. We also organise two annual family networking events and a telephone help service for parents of newly diagnosed children",

The sessions last for 3 hours and there is an opportunity to talk with other members about their disabilities and how they cope on a daily basis. They are able to share experiences and inform others about different facilities or equipment that may be available. It offers support and encouragement in regaining confidence and rejuvenating members after sight loss.

For example we’vie hosted a number of people with muscular dystrophy, spinal injuries, young amputee soldiers and cerebral palsy at Glastonbury, Wilderness and Womad festivals. We target 18-30 year olds living in the South of England to attend, with their carers, and provide support via nurses and volunteers to help out with their care and camp duties. Our camp consists of a wonderful marquee, specially adapted with hard flooring, curtained off sleeping area with full hospital profile beds, hoists and wheelchair charging facilities. The marquee is situated near to disabled showers and toilets. We work very closely with the various festival organisers to ensure they meet our high standards both prior and during the event.",

The Green Gym initiative began nationally at the prompting of a doctor who identified the benefits of such activities for patients with physical and mental health problems.Green Gyms are initiated by The Conservation Volunteers, a national charity, but are expected to be self-governing and self-funding after an initial phase which, in our case, is some time in the past.

We run an after school club that is mainly attended by children at the local junior schools and various play schemes during school holidays when children come from further afield and include those from secondary schools. Our aim is to provide these children and young people with a safe place where they can learn to interact with others and accept those who are different from themselves as they use all our facilities.The obesity rate at the end of primary schools in Blackbird Leys is 29% yet here at the playground they are able to exercise by having fun. We also aim to provide them, during the after school club with a healthy snack. They play on the structures and have endless fun as they run round often playing imaginary games. A new in-ground trampoline has added to the choice of equipment they can use. Our staff and volunteers are trained in play principles and these encourage children to choose their own activities so that the child can make a choice that fits their mood. One of our objectives is to allow the children who come to be able to find constructive ways of coping with the different feelings they might have. They use the arts and crafts facilities, many table games such as table tennis, table football and pool and will cook and garden as well as use the many outside play structures and equipment The number of people on the estate with no formal educational qualification is high and so our staff and volunteers are able to help and encourage the children to aspire and do well at school. They will sometimes bring homework for staff to look at. We have a good selection of books they can refer to and they quite often can be seen playing schools or offices. The Constitution of Blackbird Leys Adventure Playground states: \"The objects of BLAP shall be the provision of play and recreation facilities and other leisure time occupation for children resident in and around Oxford...the facilities being a) those of which children have need by reason of their youth or social and economic circumstances and b) Those which will improve the conditions of life for such children by promoting their physical, mental and spiritual well-being.\"",

For instance, nearly 40% of the children we worked with in 2012/13 were or had been looked after children, 35% had a parent or sibling with a mental health illness, and 10% had an adult member of their household in custody. As a result we run a mix of prevention and support programmes that enable young people to reflect on their situations and challenge the effects that life events have may had on them. The team is made up of professionals with a background in Psychology, Social work, Teaching, Play therapies and Youthwork. All services are researched and evaluated, and new projects are piloted with a minimum of 30 young people.",

We aim to alleviate loneliness by matching clients with volunteer befrienders. The scheme is based at the Bicester Health & Wellbeing Centre and employs a part-time paid coordinator to match volunteers and clients. Volunteers are interviewed, DBS checked and issued with a \"Do's and Don'ts\" guide to help get them started. Clients are initially visited at home by our coordinator to find out about their situation and likes/dislikes in order to make a suitable match with one of our volunteers. We hold regular coffee mornings for both volunteers and clients to celebrate our work. Clients are usually isolated and often housebound older people. Volunteers visit their clients at home regularly, usually weekly, to offer friendship and support. As well as befriending, they may help with small practical tasks around the home, shopping, light gardening work, accompany clients to appointments, and check that they are safe, well and warm.",

Groups at the hall are a broad cross-section of adults, children, families,the elderly and teenagers. Activities available to these groups are varied and include sports, arts, music and social occasions some of which are run voluntarily. Our main aims are to make the hall activities accessible and affordable to as many people in the local community as possible. Key community groups are children and young people. The manager of the hall charity has set up a rock school for this key group as an alternative to sports activities. The rock school project is available to children 6 and 16 year of age to learn various musical instruments but not all of the attendees have their own instruments.",

SHOUT had been funded to help the residents and children of the social housing, provide activities and support local groups to encourage the different residents to mix and enjoy living together. When the SHOUT organisation funding stopped and the community room needed to be managed properly, the WRCIC was created to sign the lease for the community room and to continue some of the activities that SHOUT had started - namely an end of summer fete and a Christmas Hog Roast. These events have continued using the equipment that SHOUT and others had provided but recently the main Gazebos that were donated by SHOUT to the WRCIC have collapsed making them unsafe to use at future events. On top of these events the WRCIC produces a Newsletter for the whole development three times a year, manage the website, deal with issues that arise on the development in support of the residents e.g. traffic and parking issues, issues with the railway, graffiti etc.. So, on top of managing the community room which does bring together a range of different people and is used by different groups from across the development, we create social harmony by creating the opportunity for people to meet up and get to know each other in a convivial atmosphere which creates social harmony.",

The age range is 0-5 years and the group is not only for children to meet friends and interact and to put them in good stead for when they start Nursery or School but for the parents, grandparents, childminders etc etc. We do activities such as playdough, painting, gluing, singing, storytime etc etc. We have a corner set up for the newborn babies and above, with a playmat, baby toys, bouncy chairs etc etc. We also have lots of toys for the older children ie dolls house, garage, small trikes etc etc. I have approx 30 families on my books and the Group is used every morning that we operate. It is fantastic that it is on the school grounds especially when the parents/carers drop their older siblings off at school and come straight into Group. The children are very forward after coming to Group as they have learnt how to paint, glue, draw, write etc and the teachers at the school notice this.",

We value the positive health benefits from working with animals and nature, and are passionate about removing some of the barriers to physical exercise and accessing the outdoors which many adults with learning disabilities face. Our co-farmers spend most of the day in the fresh air engaging in a range of meaningful activities, including: collecting and grading eggs, feeding farm animals, working in an organic garden, tree planting and preparing food with fresh farm produce. The project provides a hands-on programme of training, equipping participants with real world skills to transition into work and live more independently. Through this, they learn that they 'can do', raising confidence and ultimately achievement.",

Prior to that, we operated under the name K.E.E.N (Kid's Enjoy Exercise Now), registered charity number 299786. Since this transition, our provision to our disabled service users has remained unchanged. KEEN provides free sporting and social activities for children and young adults with wide ranging needs and disabilities. We aim to provide one-to-one support to our service users (our \"Athletes\") from dedicated volunteers (our \"Coaches\"), who are largely students from Oxford's two universities. We run four different sessions, which take place each week of Oxford University term time. These include a multi-sports club for ages 4 - 25 (called AllSorts), two social clubs for teenagers and adults respectively (KEEN teens and GrEAT) as well as a creative session aimed at primary school age children (Zig-Zag). In additional to these, KEEN runs various one-off holiday activities, known as \"KEEN+\", which include swimming, pantomime visits, day-trips and more. KEEN gives disabled young people from Oxfordshire the opportunity to take part in a variety of activities that are similar to those enjoyed by their able bodied peers, yet may otherwise be unavailable to them. Our high level of support means that we can cater to a wide range of needs and disabilities, and tailor activities such that everyone can get involved. By linking local disabled young people with volunteers of a similar age, we provide a safe, social environment where our Athletes can develop their confidence and skills.",

We run an after school club that is mainly attended by children at the local junior schools and various play schemes during school holidays when children come from further afield and include those from secondary schools. Our aim is to provide these children and young people with a safe place where they can learn to interact with others and accept those who are different from themselves as they use all our facilities.The obesity rate at the end of primary schools in Blackbird Leys is 29% yet here at the playground they are able to exercise by having fun. We also aim to provide them, during the after school club with a healthy snack. They play on the structures and have endless fun as they run round often playing imaginary games. A new in-ground trampoline has added to the choice of equipment they can use. Our staff and volunteers are trained in play principles and these encourage children to choose their own activities so that the child can make a choice that fits their mood. One of our objectives is to allow the children who come to be able to find constructive ways of coping with the different feelings they might have. They use the arts and crafts facilities, many table games such as table tennis, table football and pool and will cook and garden as well as use the many outside play structures and equipment The number of people on the estate with no formal educational qualification is high and so our staff and volunteers are able to help and encourage the children to aspire and do well at school. They will sometimes bring homework for staff to look at. We have a good selection of books they can refer to and they quite often can be seen playing schools or offices. The Constitution of Blackbird Leys Adventure Playground states: \"The objects of BLAP shall be the provision of play and recreation facilities and other leisure time occupation for children resident in and around Oxford...the facilities being a) those of which children have need by reason of their youth or social and economic circumstances and b) Those which will improve the conditions of life for such children by promoting their physical, mental and spiritual well-being.\"",

We aim to encourage families and children to have more of an affiliation to their neighborhood and each other through social and sports events The group will also help with aspects of the actual park, establishing more of a pride in your local area.

                    "description": "Aldates Community Transformation Initiatives (ACT!) aims to prevent ex-offenders from re-offending. We achieve this through a series of objectives: - Providing supported housing to ex-offenders who would otherwise be homeless; - Building a community where ex-offenders and homeless people are welcomed in and given hope; - Encouraging people through mentoring; - Helping people find work; - Helping people access local services. We work intensively with prisoners, ex-offenders and the homeless in the Oxfordshire area connecting with an estimated 300 people every month either in or outside prison. We specialise in “relational rehabilitation”, a significant factor contributing to criminal desistance, as supported by evidence from the National Offender Management Services, amongst others. Our activities in prison are as follows: we have been visiting 3 local prisons (HMPs Bullingdon, Huntercombe and Spring Hill) on a weekly basis for 5 years. In these we run courses, do ward rounds and build relationships with prisoners which are sustainable once they have been released. At Spring Hill prison alone we have over 30 inmates attending our course each week and are now running extra courses due to the high demand. Outside of prison, we provide services in the form of an established community programme. This consists of mentoring, supported housing, weekly community groups, monthly large-scale meals and biannual retreats. We are responsible for 2 two-bedroom properties where we house former offenders or those who would otherwise be homeless. These are currently full so we are providing supported housing to 4 men. We run two weekly group meetings for ex-offenders, the homeless and marginalised attended by approximately 35 people in total. We also run a community meal which feeds over 100 people every month and is a ‘way in’ to our other community work. These are the building blocks of our community. We have found, in keeping with the evidence (including the Ministry of Justice sponsored report \"Transforming Rehabilitation\"), that the transition for those we meet in prison to life on the outside is extremely difficult. We improve this process and enable people to successfully cross-over from an institutionalised life behind bars to a full life as contributing members of society.",

Through individually-tailored sessions, usually in the young person’s home, Project Workers encourage the young person to develop strategies for regaining their confidence and sense of safety. Young victims typically feel unsafe in their key environments: their school, town and neighbourhood. Some are so traumatised from their experience of harm that they have become virtual prisoners in their homes. Research shows that without timely support, an experience of victimisation can lead to further problems including absence from school or work, post-traumatic stress or offending behaviour later on. SAFE! works to break this cycle by promoting long-term resilience and coping skills at a crucial time of young peoples' development. This diminishes their risk of social exclusion, helps to repair their lives and works to build their potential.",

LYP combines football clubs, dance clubs, a home visiting programme, an art club, a craft/modelling club, youth clubs, mentoring groups and one-to-one advice. All of our activities are far more than 'social events' for the young people. Many of the young people we work with suffer from low self-esteem, low expectations, a lack of confidence and underdeveloped social skills, child poverty and, in particular, education underachievement. Through our projects we build constructive relationships with young people and are able to demonstrate that their expectations in life can be far greater than they often are. The young people are actively encouraged to participate in the running and leading of our projects.",

Our co-farmers spend most of the day in the fresh air engaging in a range of meaningful activities, including: collecting and grading eggs, feeding farm animals, working in an organic garden, tree planting and preparing food with fresh farm produce. The project provides a hands-on programme of training, equipping participants with real world skills to transition into work and live more independently.

We promote community cohesion and and have a number of activities ( Skating, Fun Run ) and projects to engage the young people. We are also now planning to start a under 10s Football team for the village as currently our young people go to Bicester for this.

Most of our clients are single parents, and many are from families going through the Court system.
