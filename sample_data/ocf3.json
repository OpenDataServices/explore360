We also provide a range of practical and emotional support to the family of the younger person with dementia, especially the main carer who is usually the partner. Young onset dementia is usually diagnosed when people are still working often with young families to support. In addition to the responsibilities of caring for the younger person with dementia, the partner also has often to become the main breadwinner and to bring the children up on their own. Our objective is to make this difficult situation as manageable as possible for all the family members.

We work closely with ORCC to keep up to date with standards required to run the operation. This project is part of that commitment, in that the original floor has become damaged beyond repair, it needs to be uplifted and replaced with a modern industrial strength laminate floor that will provide a safe all-purpose surface suitable for all of our many varied activities.",

It operates with three aims: 1/ to offer PWLD choice in holiday options and day-trips at affordable (/subsidised) prices; 2/ to provide respite for those who care for PWLD; 3/ to give young people training and volunteering opportunities to support this vulnerable group on our outings both for the immediate gain of assisting positively and so they are better equipped to promote community cohesion. In 2009, Yellow Submarine partnered with two day centres and a local authority and four holidays with 19 PWLD (and their carers who gained respite) benefitting. The trips that have taken place so far have been very popular and successful both with the ‘service users’, their carers and the volunteers who helped. Video feedback can be viewed on our site, with carers saying the holidays have helped increase confidence, create new friendships, and give a welcome break! Yellow Submarine believes people with learning disabilities deserve to live life to the full. We are a small award-winning charity which prides itself on giving some of the most disadvantaged people in Oxfordshire confidence, independence and a sense of self-worth. For children (aged 11-18) living in Oxfordshire we run an extensive programme in the school holidays. For adults (18+) we run residential holidays, work experience & training and a weekly social club.

The Village Hall, built in 1928 as a technical Institute & subsequently used as a village hall from 1960, badly needs refurbishing, having an inefficient heating system, rotting single glazed windows, a leaking roof & many other problems. The adjacent Freeman Hall, which was previously home to Our Street Corner Youth Club & is attached to our Village Hall, has been condemned. We have plans to demolish and rebuild this hall. In 2009 we began thinking of ways to improve our hall and began by gathering ideas from residents, user groups of the halls and professionals. We have canvassed residents of the village about the future of both halls and, acting on their ideas and needs, came up with an ambitious Rebuild & Refurbishment project for our 'much loved Village Hall' and we have been actively fundraising since 2010. In addition to accommodating our existing user groups, the plans for the proposed new hall and the original refurbished hall are: new toilet facilities, a new kitchen, a foyer café, plenty of storage space, exhibition areas, a meeting room and an office for our parish clerk. We hope to provide a new exhibition space for our History group & relevant storage for all their resources, artefacts, photographs & archives. After a successful Dementia Awareness course we also plan to have a regular afternoon for dementia sufferers & their carers, in our cafe area. The architect has designed an office for our Parish clerk, just inside the new main doors into the foyer and a committee room, in which our Parish Councillors can hold their meetings. The majority of our existing user groups have asked for better heating and ventilation, dedicated storage and in many cases increased usage and we hope to meet this need by rebuilding the Freeman Hall. We also have a list of new Users such as Drama, Choir, Scouts and Exercise groups. We would like to install retractable seating in the new hall so that it is multipurpose, allowing us the capability to put on lectures, films, concerts, pantomimes and also to retain the space for the more practical users, such as Irish Dancing, karate or the under-five’s Fun club. The newly refitted kitchen and café/foyer will join the new hall to the old, with a hatch or servery on either side. In addition to the History group and Dementia Aware group this gives us an opportunity to open the café and toilets to the public during the week and weekends. (Often a problem in villages.) We already hire the hall out for birthday parties or dances and with the increased facilities and outside area could also function as a wedding venue. The bridal party could walk from St. Matthew’s Parish Church! The renovations would allow the hall to be used by small businesses for conferences. There have also been requests for a weekly post office, which we could site in the Parish Clerk's office and would be an added facility for our more elderly residents or for those who do not drive.",

We consider it our responsibility to create pathways for young actors, directors, writers, stage managers, designers and technicians into the theatre industry. We strive to serve our audience by producing high quality, affordable, accessible theatre for all ages. We believe good theatre should entertain, move and spark debate, but that it also enriches lives and brings communities together. We are 100% inclusive as a company and are committed to providing a nurturing, safe environment where young people can be creative without fear of judgement or failure. We promote the use of theatre as an educational tool and regularly tour our own original productions to secondary schools on issues we consider vital to the personal, social and health education of young people. We are also dedicated to providing career development opportunities for professionals in Oxfordshire. We are delighted to have given many local creatives their first jobs, commissioned works from previously unpublished playwrights, and encourage our artists to explore many different avenues with us. The services we provide: Weekly Youth Theatre classes. A theatre in education programme for the schools of Oxfordshire. An annual pantomime for and starring members of the local community. Other performance projects designed to include and connect with our community. A series of workshops we deliver to secondary schools and colleges on Improvisation, Brechtian Theatre, Monologue technique and Stanislavski. Tuition and coaching for young people who wish to audition for further acting training at a drama school level. Opportunities for career progression of our established professional artistes. Vital experience for Oxfordshire based creatives early in their careers in every aspect of the theatre industry. To tell you a little more about how we work with young people, CTC’s on-going policy is to work alongside them in every aspect of the development of our community productions. This application was initially co-written with three of our young members, then proof- read and tweaked by three others. Throughout the duration of initial planning from script writing, marketing strategy and all the way through to rehearsal and performances of the project, we enlist direct input from our young members, whilst at the same time mentor and continually feed back to them in order to nurture and develop their performing arts and arts admin skills as a whole. Every member of our ‘Senior Youth Group’ and the CTC Academy has been and will be involved in developing and adapting the project to suit the company’s purpose, making their contribution continual and integral to the shaping of the production. This is especially essential on this particular project as the play is designed for their target age group, so it is of vital importance that we find a way to tell the story and get the information across that we want to in their \"voice\", in a way that is not patronising to teenagers. We believe our approach is unique because we work as one company. We not only nurture our young people's creative talents but also encourage practical development of their learning by giving them professional-level responsibility and improving their general awareness of the arts, as well as the opportunity to work with professional actors and directors to shape their own professional practice.",

We run a wide range of initiatives in state schools across the country, focusing especially on children in socially excluded inner city regions, and we also run projects which introduce Classics to adults in city communities. In October 2013 we opened the East Oxford Community Classics Centre, a community centre hosted at a secondary state school in East Oxford, which runs a wide range of projects, events, courses, workshops, talks and exhibitions targeted both for Cheney pupils within the school and also for the wider community."

Global smile encourages everyone of all abilities and unlike a team its based on a come along as u wish basis where as with clubs etc u have to commit and pay yearly fees which for some parents this is not possible and due to family circumstances they may not be able to pay fees or be able to get to games etc . Global smile soccer centres also encourage children with behavioural and disabilities to come along and join in as unlike teams we provide an all inclusive environment currently Global has one girl with Cerebal Paulsy who benefits tremendously from interacting with the children and joining in her parents are delighted that she can take part in sport without having to attend a group specifically for disabled children we also have several children with behavioral conditions as well as a child whom is blind in one eye. For the older ones 14-21 global provides sessions and provide opportunities to the ones who show an interesting becoming a volunteer and then they can come and learn via the qualified coaches in the younger ones sessions and also assist them with helping them get onto a course for their coaching qualifications giving the older ones opportunities for a career pathway. As a parent volunteer I am trying so hard to help the project succeed but without a little funding support its going to become really hard to sustain the project. The coaches provide a kind caring environment and make the children feel so much more confident in what they do its just amazing.Global also help the children and youths get into clubs if this is what they wish to do and send children to charter standard clubs who they know have a very good standard of childrens welfare and keeping football fun they also are always happy to give parents advise on anything to. Another thing is global play music whilst doing their sessions and this promotes a lovely atmosphere where both children and adults enjoy this.",

The Festival consists of approximately 30 events packed into the 3rd weekend in October and attracts up to 3,000 visitors, mostly from within 20 square miles though increasingly, as the reputation of the Festival has grown, from further afield. The Festival is a celebration of the written word in all its forms, from books through poetry, theatre, cinema & song and we work with both national and local organisations to bring this unique experience to life each year. Most notably, we have collaborated with the BBC for several events including Radio 4's Any Questions? The main element of the festival is author based talks and discussions - usually about their new works which includes all genres from fiction to science and history to gardening. More famous visitors have included, Charles Spencer, Jonathan Dimbleby, Mary Berry, Nick Robinson, Will Gompertz, Michael Morpurgo, Sophie Dahl and over 100 others, each of whom have brought us fascinating facts and stories.These talks are augmented with theatre productions, music of all types, cinema and an art-show based in Thame Museum. It all adds up to a heady weekend of huge fun and not a little challenge for all concerned. In addition to the main events, we host short story writing competitions, creative writing workshops and each year we host a 'new writings' event that so far has involved two musicals and a play. Our objective is to deliver a friendly, accessible (both in content and price), interesting and involved experience for our fesitval visitors and is summed up in our logo; Participate... Enjoy...

We believe that stories are not just important for children’s learning and development; they are a fundamental part of what it means to be human. To that end we are gradually transforming our site in central Oxford (thanks to an Arts Council Small capital grant and other support from Trusts and Foundations) into a new kind of museum — the first of its kind — celebrating story in all its forms and acting as a hub for our education and engagement work. Since 2005 we have been running storytelling programmes in schools and communities across Oxfordshire that show the power of stories to inspire and transform learning. Our work has particularly targeted some of the most disadvantaged areas of the county and we work in partnership with a wide variety of communities and other like-minded organisations.",

Objectives: To model techniques that create stillness e.g. T’ai Chi for teachers & reflective story-telling To help reduce stress in staff by direct intervention such as stress INSET and pupil mentoring/enrichment To facilitate the development of spirituality in primary schools by working with staff & pupils To affirm ageing volunteers by developing their confidence as volunteers Activities: Over the last 5 years we have provided small-group workshop activities for some 3000 children from 20 local schools. Our major on-going project, Hello Abingdon, develops citizenship and literacy skills in teams of local & forces' children, but we also offer workshops on emotional literacy and R.E., as in our one large event, which attracts 300 children each year. We offer supported work experience places for SEN pupils from our three secondary schools (20 placements to date) and have delivered whole-school INSETS on stress-management to two primary schools. All our activities are provided free to state schools.",

Through individually-tailored sessions, usually in the young person’s home, Project Workers encourage the young person to develop strategies for regaining their confidence and sense of safety. Young victims typically feel unsafe in their key environments: their school, town and neighbourhood. Some are so traumatised from their experience of harm that they have become virtual prisoners in their homes. Research shows that without timely support, an experience of victimisation can lead to further problems including absence from school or work, post-traumatic stress or offending behaviour later on. SAFE! works to break this cycle by promoting long-term resilience and coping skills at a crucial time of young peoples' development. This diminishes their risk of social exclusion, helps to repair their lives and works to build their potential.",

All of our activities are far more than 'social events' for the young people. Many of the young people we work with suffer from low self-esteem, low expectations, a lack of confidence and underdeveloped social skills, child poverty and, in particular, education underachievement. Through our projects we build constructive relationships with young people and are able to demonstrate that their expectations in life can be far greater than they often are.

The organisation of the club is overseen and monitored by a volunteer management committee made up of local parents and residents, staff and local Councillors. The twice weekly club sessions are staffed by qualified play workers and supported by Oxfordshire Play Association. Launched in March 2011 the JYC supports up to 95 children each week at two club sessions. It is a totally inclusive club offering a wide range of activities for children aged 6 – 12 years. There is a nominal charge of 50p per child per session. This fee is waived if a parent is unable to afford the subscription. We offer specialist support to children with ADHD, Autism and Special Educational Needs (SEN) . Over 30% of children attending have some form of additional need. Many children in Rose Hill have challenging lives which impact on their behaviour. The therapeutic nature of play is crucial to their social, emotional and behavioural development. JYC offers children the opportunity to do things THEIR way, giving them autonomy, promoting self expression, allowing them to develop confidence, self worth, creativity and resilience. Often a stark contrast to life within school and home. JYC offers these children a structure of support and a choice of activities. When their needs are met (fun, societal, good food, positive reinforcement, independent choice) their behaviour improves considerably, they work through their challenges using play and spending time with trusted adults. For the majority of children attending, JYC is the only facilitated play opportunity in their lives. For the children not attending JYC, it is likely that there is none. The club also offers: ? A Young Leaders (YLs) programme for older children where: * YLs support and mentor younger ones, learn positive behaviour, social skills and self worth and support staff in chosen activities or run them independently ? A volunteering and training programme: *JYC offers support and training to local people wishing to gain experience working with children ? A healthy eating and cooking project: *children prepare, cook and serve a hot healthy tea at every session, lead by qualified nutritionist and kitchen team Our aims and objectives are: To give a child a sense of their own worth and capability To create a nurturing, safe and creative atmosphere To encourage positive language, social skills and communication To give enjoyment and respite from a child’s pressured and often traumatic life To provide an opportunity to engage in different kinds of innovative projects To work with children to raise their self esteem, self confidence and independence through creative activities To celebrate their success and encourage pride in their achievements",

Most had been at Scouts and we felt passionately that they should be able to continue their journey in Scouting. Word has spread and we have 22 members from across the city now, not just Marston .We meet weekly plus offer weekend activities for them. We invite visitors to the group to show their activity eg fencing, knotting or organsie Ready Steady Cook competitions, games in the park , hikes etc.We actively encourage our Explorers to put \"something back\". To this end we recently held a coffee morning fund raiser and invited the local community . We and they, enjoyed it so much we are going to offer cream teas in the summer so as to continue to forge community links, particularly with the elderly. Come if you can , the homemade cakes produced for the coffee morning were very impressive ! As a result of this initiative the Scouts decided to make a donation from their profits to a project that helps street children. Some have undergone training to become young leaders and are volunteering now in their own time at various Scout troops. Others are working in Charity shops shops and have helped at dance classes tor younger children. We exist on the termly subs that the Explorers pay , trips to the park or cooking on an open fire are cheap As we have started from scratch we have no equipment of our own.We are reliant on borrowing tents from the local Scout troop, if dates clash we cant take the whole unit camping. We aim to subsidise all of our activities to make them accessible to all.",

Prior to that, we operated under the name K.E.E.N (Kid's Enjoy Exercise Now), registered charity number 299786. Since this transition, our provision to our disabled service users has remained unchanged. KEEN provides free sporting and social activities for children and young adults with wide ranging needs and disabilities. We aim to provide one-to-one support to our service users (our \"Athletes\") from dedicated volunteers (our \"Coaches\"), who are largely students from Oxford's two universities. We run four different sessions, which take place each week of Oxford University term time. These include a multi-sports club for ages 4 - 25 (called AllSorts), two social clubs for teenagers and adults respectively (KEEN teens and GrEAT) as well as a creative session aimed at primary school age children (Zig-Zag). In additional to these, KEEN runs various one-off holiday activities, known as \"KEEN+\", which include swimming, pantomime visits, day-trips and more. KEEN gives disabled young people from Oxfordshire the opportunity to take part in a variety of activities that are similar to those enjoyed by their able bodied peers, yet may otherwise be unavailable to them. Our high level of support means that we can cater to a wide range of needs and disabilities, and tailor activities such that everyone can get involved. By linking local disabled young people with volunteers of a similar age, we provide a safe, social environment where our Athletes can develop their confidence and skills.",

                    "description": "Oxford Conservation Volunteers (OCV) is a local community group that has been carrying out practical work to protect and enhance green spaces in the Oxford area since 1977. The group is entirely run by volunteers and organises work parties every weekend throughout the year at nature reserves around Oxfordshire. The tasks are free and open to all, including students, professionals, unemployed and homeless volunteers. Transport to and from tasks is free and volunteers are only asked to provide sensible clothing, a packed lunch and lots of enthusiasm. Membership is optional and costs £5 per year for those who can afford it, but is not required to participate in the tasks. This ensures that our group is as inclusive as possible and that volunteers from disadvantaged backgrounds are able to participate fully in our activities. One of our key aims is to provide training in countryside management skills to our volunteers. Through this training, a number of our unemployed volunteers have been able to gain the skills that have been instrumental in finding paid employment, particularly in the gardening sector. OCV undertakes a wide variety of projects, including traditional countryside management tasks such as coppicing, dry-stone walling and hedge-laying, and other tasks such as footpath maintenance, fencing, pond management, scrub clearance and fen raking. In 2014, OCV volunteers worked an estimated 3000 volunteer hours and worked at 27 sites around Oxford and Oxfordshire. OCV’s clients include well-recognised organisations such as Oxford City Council, Natural England, the Buckinghamshire Berkshire & Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust, and local organisations such as The Friends of the Trap Grounds and the Oxford Preservation Trust.",

We work with young people aged 8 - 18 who might be struggling to meet the curriculum in school, who speak English as a second language, who have been identified by the school as 'needing extra support to tackle poor literacy', or who might have been identified as being disruptive in school or in the local community. OAL also works with young people who have been identified by schools and educational workers as being able to achieve higher grades given the right support outside of school hours. The workshops are run by professional writers/tutors and volunteers and are designed to encourage re-engagement with learning and with literature/story that will improve understanding and performance in education. The workshops involve each young person completing an original piece of creative writing with the help of the tutors and their peers. Critical reflection and feedback is encouraged throughout as a way of nurturing confidence and to promote team building within the group. Peer-to-peer mentoring also encourages respect for fellow cohorts and a new critical appreciation of the way language can be applied in creative and practical ways. Such understanding improves language and written skills, encourages an appreciation of learning and greatly improves future chances in education, in work and in personal life. Our aim is to help all of the young people we work with to reach their full potential and to reengage with learning and good literacy. Other benefits include a renewed appreciation of story/literature that we have seen improve behaviour and engagement in class and in personal life. All of the stories created during OAL workshops are then edited by professionals and uploaded onto our website as part of the OAL Project which aims to collect 200 stories this year alone. These stories will act as a resource and inspiration to other young people across the UK. There will also be teaching resources and information/activities for parents to help them engage their children and continue to improve literacy and an appreciation of learning. Once edited and uploaded onto our website, the stories are accompanied by a short biography and photograph of the author. This inclusion in the OAL Project Story Collection is also invaluable for improving self-confidence and creating a well-deserved sense of achievement. We also try to run a small Graduation Ceremony at the end of each course and have actors/storytellers come in and read the stories so that the young people get to experience their work in a new light and enjoy a sense of completion. Fellow students, teachers, family and friends are all invited to the graduation. The OAL Project will eventually grow to incorporate Mp3 downloads of spoken stories, artwork created by young people involved in the project in response to the stories (like we are doing now with our Telling Stories event to be held at SJE Arts in April) and recordings of songs and poems created during workshops. The overall aim of OAL is to inspire young people and to show them that words are not simply abstract but a vital means of creative and practical expression, and that good literacy can greatly improve a person’s future chances in life in all areas."

The Community Learning Service has developed a range of accredited modules to support Self Directed Support, and these are currently being delivered with funding from the European Social Fund to both service users, and people who wish to become Personal Assistants.",

The villages are isolated communities with few facilities and transport links. The majority of members are in the 70s and 80s. Many have mobility constraints and live alone. Many do not have personal transport. The Club has a committee of seven volunteers who organize an activity or visit each month. The activities are based on encouraging individuals to engage in events which help to minimize isolation and promote the maintenance of independent living. This is achieved by providing mental stimulation and physical activities which encourage health and well being for the elderly and frail who are disadvantaged and isolated living alone on limited incomes. Activities reflect the needs and wants of the members and for many the trips are the only time they visit places outside of their communities.",

We provide information and recreational activities to improve quality of life, help develop friendships and build self esteem. We also offer support to parents and carers through providing a meeting place for them to share concerns and access information. We support our members so that they can fully engage with community activities, thereby encouraging social inclusion, lessening isolation and increasing independence. We aim to encourage understanding and acceptance of disability in the community. We meet three times a month for activities such as discos, sports coaching, quizzes, bowling,meals out and visits to shows. We have also run workshops in the past in which members have made items that we have sold at the local market. Our workshops offered work experience to our members and the satisfaction of selling their products and contributing to society through work. The working group, called the 'Wombles' won a £3500 grant from Thame Town Council. Our vision for the future is to provide a building to act as both a social hub and a workshop to make craft goods. We also want to run a cafe to give our members valuable work experience and the skills to enable them to enter the workplace and become independent. Fewer than one in five people with a learning disability work, yet according to Mencap, at least 65% would like to work, for the same reasons as everyone else - for a sense of purpose and identity.",

Volunteers are interviewed, DBS checked and issued with a \"Do's and Don'ts\" guide to help get them started. Clients are initially visited at home by our coordinator to find out about their situation and likes/dislikes in order to make a suitable match with one of our volunteers. We hold regular coffee mornings for both volunteers and clients to celebrate our work. Clients are usually isolated and often housebound older people. Volunteers visit their clients at home regularly, usually weekly, to offer friendship and support. As well as befriending, they may help with small practical tasks around the home, shopping, light gardening work, accompany clients to appointments, and check that they are safe, well and warm.",

We offer a drop-in advice on practically any issue; if we can not help then we can signpost to agencies that can. We rely totally on volunteers to function on a day to day basis; the dedication and commitment given by our workers is astounding and this contributes immensely to our success in working within the community. Volunteers are given relevant training designed to assist them in improving their skills, achieve personal or professional development and to add substance to their CV. We also offer training and support to enable volunteers to re-enter the workplace and progress in their own careers. BIVC is responsible for editing, producing and delivering the local newsletter ‘Your Village Voice’, to over 1200 homes and businesses in the village. We are now the main communication hub of the village and are trying to develop community building projects. Berinsfield is an urban village set in rural surroundings that brings its own set of problems. The village has over 4,000 residents a large proportion of which are on benefits or low wages, single parents or older people. The Information centre has been running for approx 39 years. The centre provides a place where people can discuss their problems in an informal atmosphere but obtain professional and knowledgeable assistance. This is open to surrounding villages as well. We provide advice on all aspects of benefits, pensions, housing, advocacy, debt advice, crisis intervention, outreach, driving scheme, local information, community activities and volunteer training, we also create and distribute a free local magazine.",

We run an after school club that is mainly attended by children at the local junior schools and various play schemes during school holidays when children come from further afield and include those from secondary schools. Our aim is to provide these children and young people with a safe place where they can learn to interact with others and accept those who are different from themselves as they use all our facilities.The obesity rate at the end of primary schools in Blackbird Leys is 29% yet here at the playground they are able to exercise by having fun. We also aim to provide them, during the after school club with a healthy snack. They play on the structures and have endless fun as they run round often playing imaginary games. A new in-ground trampoline has added to the choice of equipment they can use. Our staff and volunteers are trained in play principles and these encourage children to choose their own activities so that the child can make a choice that fits their mood. One of our objectives is to allow the children who come to be able to find constructive ways of coping with the different feelings they might have. They use the arts and crafts facilities, many table games such as table tennis, table football and pool and will cook and garden as well as use the many outside play structures and equipment The number of people on the estate with no formal educational qualification is high and so our staff and volunteers are able to help and encourage the children to aspire and do well at school. They will sometimes bring homework for staff to look at. We have a good selection of books they can refer to and they quite often can be seen playing schools or offices. The Constitution of Blackbird Leys Adventure Playground states: \"The objects of BLAP shall be the provision of play and recreation facilities and other leisure time occupation for children resident in and around Oxford...the facilities being a) those of which children have need by reason of their youth or social and economic circumstances and b) Those which will improve the conditions of life for such children by promoting their physical, mental and spiritual well-being.\"",

                    "description": "Aldates Community Transformation Initiatives (ACT!) aims to prevent ex-offenders from re-offending. We achieve this through a series of objectives: - Providing supported housing to ex-offenders who would otherwise be homeless; - Building a community where ex-offenders and homeless people are welcomed in and given hope; - Encouraging people through mentoring; - Helping people find work; - Helping people access local services. We work intensively with prisoners, ex-offenders and the homeless in the Oxfordshire area connecting with an estimated 300 people every month either in or outside prison. We specialise in “relational rehabilitation”, a significant factor contributing to criminal desistance, as supported by evidence from the National Offender Management Services, amongst others. Our activities in prison are as follows: we have been visiting 3 local prisons (HMPs Bullingdon, Huntercombe and Spring Hill) on a weekly basis for 5 years. In these we run courses, do ward rounds and build relationships with prisoners which are sustainable once they have been released. At Spring Hill prison alone we have over 30 inmates attending our course each week and are now running extra courses due to the high demand. Outside of prison, we provide services in the form of an established community programme. This consists of mentoring, supported housing, weekly community groups, monthly large-scale meals and biannual retreats. We are responsible for 2 two-bedroom properties where we house former offenders or those who would otherwise be homeless. These are currently full so we are providing supported housing to 4 men. We run two weekly group meetings for ex-offenders, the homeless and marginalised attended by approximately 35 people in total. We also run a community meal which feeds over 100 people every month and is a ‘way in’ to our other community work. These are the building blocks of our community. We have found, in keeping with the evidence (including the Ministry of Justice sponsored report \"Transforming Rehabilitation\"), that the transition for those we meet in prison to life on the outside is extremely difficult. We improve this process and enable people to successfully cross-over from an institutionalised life behind bars to a full life as contributing members of society.",
